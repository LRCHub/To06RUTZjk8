There's something under your bed
There's something that's gonna hurt you
There's something inside your head
There's something that's wants to see you
And it's okay to be paranoid
It all seems to be coming after you
So don't worry 'bout what they say
It only matters what I do

Be my dress up doll
Let me do I want with you
And it's all your fault
You know why they're coming after you
Be my dress up doll take you everywhere I go
And I'll never fall, keeping you as my dress up doll

Do you know what's inside your closet
Do you know what is waiting there for you
Do you know that I'm waiting for it
For you to wake up so I can play with you
And it's okay to be paranoid
I have so many pretty things for you
So don't worry 'bout what they say
It only matters what I do

Be my dress up doll
Let me do I want with you
And it's all your fault
You know why they're coming after you
Be my dress up doll take you everywhere I go
And I'll never fall, keeping you as my dress up

Be my dress up doll
Let me do I want with you
And it's all your fault
You know why they're coming after you
Be my dress up doll take you everywhere I go
And I'll never fall, keeping you as my dress up doll

Do you wanna keep me as your master
Do you wanna be my doll forever
Do you wanna keep playing with me
Do you wanna be
Do you wanna be

Do you wanna keep me as your master
Do you wanna be my doll forever
Do you wanna keep playing with me
Do you wanna be
Do you wanna be

Be my dress up doll
Let me do I want with you
And it's all your fault
You know why they're coming after you
Be my dress up doll take you everywhere I go
And I'll never fall, keeping you as my dress up

Be my dress up doll
Let me do I want with you
And it's all your fault
You know why they're coming after you
Be my dress up doll take you everywhere I go
And I'll never fall, keeping you as my dress up doll
