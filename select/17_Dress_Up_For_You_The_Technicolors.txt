Starlight, you're always dancing with the dark
I can barely see the coastline
We're just a silent silhouette apart
Run it back and now it's quarter 'four
I'm spun out on your floor
You're on the phone, your words are such a poem
I whisper you a sentimental truth
It's the way you laugh when you're not amused

It really makes me wanna dress up for you
Dress up for you
I'll dress up for you even if it's the best I can do

You're gonna make a movie, you're gonna be a star
I try to call but I can't reach ya
Forever wonder where you are
Losing all control with plastic wine
I'm sitting in a sky of starry eyes... Flight 749
I'm dizzy on you, and I know you feel it too
It's the way you laugh when you're not amused

It really makes me wanna dress up for you
Dress up for you
I'll dress up for you even if it's the best I can do
'Cause I know you want me too...

(The best I can do)
(The best I can do)

I'm gonna see your movie, now that you're a movie star
And now I know I'll never reach ya, forever wonder where you are
But I'll still dress up for you, dress up for you
Even if it's the best I can do
